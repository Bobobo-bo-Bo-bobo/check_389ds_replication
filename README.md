**_Note:_** Because I'm running my own servers for several years, main development is done at at https://git.ypbind.de/cgit/check_389ds_replication/

----

# Preface
In larger LDAP setups (with 389 directory sever as LDAP server) the data is replicated to one or more LDAP master and/or slave servers.
To ensure data integrity and consistency the state of the replication should be checked at regular intervals.

This check allows for checking the state of replication of an 389ds master or slave server and can be integrated
in a Nagios based monitoring solution like [Icinga2](https://icinga.com/products/)

# Build requirements
This check is implemented in Go so, obviously, a Go compiler is required.

Building this programm requires the [go-ldap.v3](https://github.com/go-ldap/ldap/) library.

# Command line parameters
:heavy_exclamation_mark: **This check only works with 389 directory server** :heavy_exclamation_mark:

This check requires a recent version of the 389 directory server with support for the `nsds5replicaLastUpdateStatusJSON` attribute.

The design has been described in [Replication Agreement Status Message Improvements](http://www.port389.org/docs/389ds/design/repl-agmt-status-design.html) and was implemented in [#49602 Improve replication status messages](https://pagure.io/389-ds-base/issue/49602)
